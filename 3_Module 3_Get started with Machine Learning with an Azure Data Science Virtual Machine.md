# When to use an Azure DSVM?

- 5 minutes

Data scientists typically need to install and configure a variety of software for machine learning development. Once created, these environments frequently need to be reconfigured for additional data science projects. The Azure Data Science Virtual Machines (Azure DSVM) makes it easy to maintain consistency in the environments in which you are working.

Additionally, each DSVM provides code samples in the form of Jupyter notebooks and scripts in languages such as Python and R to help you learn about Microsoft on-premises and Azure-based machine learning services.

- Samples in Python explain scenarios such as how to connect with Azure cloud data stores and work with Azure Machine Learning.
- Azure Machine Learning samples that show how to build machine learning and deep learning models with Machine Learning.
- Deep learning samples published by the Cognitive Toolkit team at Microsoft to demonstrate using Microsoft Cognitive Services.
- Samples in R explain how to compare open-source R and Microsoft R. And they explain how to operationalize models with Machine Learning Services (R, Python) in SQL Server.

# Types of Azure Data Science Virtual Machines

- 5 minutes

Each type of DSVM is designed to support different types of machine learning, for example general predictive modeling, deep learning, and geospatial AI.

## Choose between Windows DSVMs or Linux DSVMs

Currently there are two different types of Azure DSVM: Windows DSVMs and Linux DSVMs. Azure offers a Windows Server 2016 and Windows Server 2012 version. Linux DSVMs offer Ubuntu 16.04 LTS and CentOS 7.4 versions.

![Screenshot of Windows and Linux DSVMs.](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/data-ai-cert/intro-to-azure-dsvm/media/3-windows-linux.png)

## Understand deep learning

Deep learning is a popular approach when trying to tackle questions involving neural networks with large datasets. Deep learning requires specific tools to manage requirements for the problem at hand. The Deep Learning DSVM comes preconfigured and preinstalled with many of these tools.

Training deep learning models is computationally intense. For better model training performance select a high-speed GPU-based machine, which will significantly speed up machine model training.

## Use a geographic information system with DSVM

![Icon for the Geo AI DSVM](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/data-ai-cert/intro-to-azure-dsvm/media/3-geo-ai-dsvm.png)

The DSVM has analytic capabilities optimized for geospatial and location data. It has the ArcGIS Pro geographic information system integrated into the VM to support advanced geographic-based AI questions. It also has other conventional data science tools preconfigured and preinstalled for ease-of-use.

# Use cases for a DSVM

- 5 minutes

You can use DSVMs for many different uses.

## Collaborate as a team using DSVMs

By replacing physical machines with cloud-based VMs, the data science team can easily and quickly create and modify a machine learning environment with the same baseline configuration. This ensures that all the data science team members have a consistent development environment.

## Address issues with DSVMs

A data science training class requires students to have an environment with the same software installed and configured so examples and labs work consistently. With the DSVM, the problems caused by package incompatibility and language versions are reduced. The students focus on the data science content, and the trainers don't have to spend class time debugging issues. The VMs can be paused or deleted, so you only pay while the machines are in use. With the DSVM, the users can even train themselves using the preloaded code samples.

## Use on-demand elastic capacity for large-scale projects

Data science hackathons (or *competitions*), or large-scale data modeling and exploration require scaled out hardware capacity, typically for a short duration. The DSVM can help replicate the data science environment on demand, allowing experiments requiring high-powered computing resources to be run.

## Experiment and evaluate on a DSVM

You can use the DSVM to learn about tools and topics such as:

- Microsoft Machine Learning Server
- SQL Server
- Microsoft Visual Studio tools
- Jupyter Notebooks
- Deep learning tools
- Popular Machine Learning toolkits
- Other new tools popular in the community

Because the DSVM can be set up quickly, you can apply it in short-term usage scenarios such as replicating published experiments, executing demonstrations, following walkthroughs in online sessions, and doing tutorials. Many sample scripts and data are provided to demonstrate how to use various Microsoft products that support data science and machine learning such as SQL Server, Machine Learning Server, Azure Machine Learning service, and Microsoft Cognitive Services.

## Learn about DSVMs and deep learning

You can use the DSVM for training models using deep learning algorithms, and select GPU-based hardware when you create the VM. When training large models, or when you require fast computations, you can switch to a GPU-based VM. The Windows Server 2016 edition of DSVM comes preinstalled with GPU drivers, frameworks, and GPU versions of deep learning frameworks. The Linux edition has deep learning on GPU enabled on both the CentOS and Ubuntu DSVMs. You can deploy the Ubuntu, CentOS, or Windows 2016 edition of DSVM to a non-GPU–based Azure VM, in which case all of the deep learning frameworks will fall back to the CPU mode.

# Deep Learning Virtual Machine

- 5 minutes

Deep Learning Virtual Machines (DLVMs) use GPU-based hardware that provide increased mathematical calculation speed for faster model training. Windows and Ubuntu operating systems support this variation of Azure DSVM. To understand why you would choose a DLVM, we need to understand the difference between machine learning and deep learning. Then we will look at what the Deep Learning Virtual Machine offers.

## Understand differences between Deep Learning and Machine Learning

Deep learning and machine learning are two terms that are frequently used in the world of data science. So, let's define them to get a better understanding of when Deep learning virtual machines are useful.

*Deep learning* is encompassed in machine learning because it also uses algorithms in the same way. However, instead of needing intervention, the algorithm decides what to do with the results and whether they're accurate. To make the final decision, deep learning uses a method called *artificial neural networks*, which is a process that simulates the decision process of the human brain's neural network.

![Icon of a brain.](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/data-ai-cert/explore-azure-dsvm-types/media/4-dlvm.png)

*Machine learning* is the process of using algorithms to learn from data and make decisions based on that data. After the algorithm has made a prediction, a data scientist looks at the predictions and determines their accuracy and how to move forward with the results.

## Simplify tasks with DLVMs

Creating a neural network can be difficult because there are many tools that a data scientist could use to complete that task. This can be intimidating. The DLVM simplifies that process by including preconfigured tools for different situations.

## Key features

Key features of DLVMs include:

- All tools that are included in a Linux-based DSVM
- Deep-learning tools
- GPU-based VMs
- Catalog of tools and samples
- Samples of different deep-learning scenarios

Although deep learning falls under the umbrella of machine learning, deep learning requires a specific set of tools to build advanced neural networks. The DLVM is a powerful tool that aids in the deep learning process by providing preinstalled and preconfigured necessary technology.

# Exercise - Create an Azure Data Science Virtual Machine

- 10 minutes

This module requires a sandbox to complete. A sandbox gives you access to Azure resources. Your Azure subscription will not be charged.

Activate sandbox

Creating an Azure Data Science VM for Linux or Windows is exactly like creating any other type of VM - we're just using a specific image. Let's create a Windows-based DSVM through the Azure portal.

You can start right in the Azure portal and use the **+ Create New Resource** support, or use the DSVM product pages. Let's use the latter for this exercise.

1. Make sure to activate the Azure Sandbox.

2. Navigate to [the Microsoft Azure Data Science Virtual Machines product page ](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/virtual-machines/data-science-virtual-machines/) in a new browser window or tab.

3. Scroll down until you see the DSVM editions as shown in the following image.

   ![Screenshot of three DSVM edition options.](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/data-ai-cert/provision-and-use-azure-dsvm/media/2-dsvm-editions.png)

4. Select the **Data Science Virtual Machine – Windows 2016** link.

5. On the description screen, select the **Get it now** button.

   ![Screenshot of the Data Science Virtual Machine - Windows 2016 offering in Azure Marketplace.](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/data-ai-cert/provision-and-use-azure-dsvm/media/2-dsvm-windows2016.png)

6. When you see the **Create this app in Azure** dialog, select **Continue**.

   ![Screenshot of the Create this app in Azure dialog.](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/data-ai-cert/provision-and-use-azure-dsvm/media/2-dsvm-creation.png)

7. The browser window will take you to the Azure portal. If you are prompted for your credentials, make sure to use the same ones you used to activate the Sandbox.

8. Verify that you are using the correct Azure directory - **MICROSOFT LEARN SANDBOX**. You should see the directory under your email address in the top right of the portal window (by your profile picture). If you are *not* in the Sandbox, you will need to change your directory with the following steps:

   1. Click the **Directory+Subscription** icon in the toolbar across the top of the portal. ![Screenshot showing the Directory + Subscription icon](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/data-ai-cert/provision-and-use-azure-dsvm/media/2-change-directory.png)
   2. Select **All Directories** and make sure **Microsoft Learn Sandbox** is the selected choice.
   3. Verify the directory is changed under your profile picture.

9. The portal should be on the **Data Science Virtual Machine – Windows 2016** screen.

   ![Screenshot of the Azure portal, Data Science Virtual Machine – Windows 2016.](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/data-ai-cert/provision-and-use-azure-dsvm/media/2-create-dsvm-azure-portal.png)

10. Select **Create** to begin configuring a virtual machine (VM). Set the appropriate values into each of the fields using the following suggestions.

    - **Subscription**. Verify that *Concierge Subscription* is selected. If it's not present in the list, make sure you activated the Sandbox and are logged in with the same credentials.
    - **Resource group**. A *resource group* is a container that holds related resources for an Azure solution. Make sure the pre-created Sandbox resource group [Sandbox Resource Group Name] is selected.
    - **Virtual Machine name**. Enter a name for the data science server you are creating. For this example, we'll use **Win2016**.
    - **Region**. The free sandbox allows you to create resources in a subset of the Azure global regions. Select a region from the following list when you create resources::::row::: :::column::: - West US 2 - South Central US - Central US - East US - West Europe :::column-end::: :::column::: - Southeast Asia - Japan East - Brazil South - Australia Southeast - Central India :::column-end::: :::row-end:::
    - **Image**: Do not change this setting, but verify that it says **Data Science Virtual Machine – Windows 2016**.
    - **Size**. Normally you would leave this setting alone - you want a lot of CPUs and memory to perform data science tasks. However, for this exercise, change the size to be **DS2_v2 (Standard)**.
    - **User Name**. Enter an administration account ID. You will need this later to access the VM.
    - **Password**. Enter the administration account password. You will need this later as well to access the VM.
    - **Already have a Windows license?** Leave this as the default, which is set to **No**.

11. Select **Review and Create**, it should validate and show you all the details about what is going to be provisioning. Don't worry about the section stating **Subscription credits apply**, you won't be charged.

12. Select the **Create** button to provision the DSVM.

VM provisioning takes a few minutes. You should see an icon of a blue line under a bell [Screenshot of the bell icon.](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/data-ai-cert/provision-and-use-azure-dsvm/media/2-bell-icon.png), which indicates that Azure is busy building the VM. After this process completes, the VM main properties window will appear.

# Exercise - Connect to a DSVM

- 15 minutes

You can always access your VM from the Azure portal. Since we created a Windows VM, we will use the Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) approach. If we had created a Linux DSVM, we would utilize a Secure Shell (SSH) tool.

## Use RDP to connect to the Windows DSVM

1. Switch back to the Azure portal.

2. In the left sidebar of the portal, select **Virtual Machines**.

3. Locate the DSVM you just created (**Win2016**) and select it. This will bring up the **Overview** blade.

   ![Screenshot of the Virtual Machines blade.](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/data-ai-cert/provision-and-use-azure-dsvm/media/3-create-vm.png)

4. From the **Overview** blade, select the **Connect** link highlighted below.

   ![Screenshot of the Connect button selected in the Virtual Machines blade.](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/data-ai-cert/provision-and-use-azure-dsvm/media/3-connect-vm.png)

5. Select the **Download RDP file** button to download the RDP configuration using your browser. You can open the Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) file directly, or you can download it and then open it with the Remote Desktop Connection app on Windows, macOS, or most Linux distributions.

6. In the **Remote Desktop Connection** dialog box, click **Connect** (this is for Windows - other clients might have a slightly different experience but should be similar).

   ![Screenshot of the Connect to Virtual Machine section.](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/data-ai-cert/provision-and-use-azure-dsvm/media/3-connect-rdp-config.png)

7. Enter the administrator user ID and password that you used when you created the VM. On Windows clients it might default to your logged on user as the username - you can select the **More choices** option to allow you to enter a different username.

   ![Screenshot of the Remote Desktop Connection warning box, asking if you still want to continue.](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/data-ai-cert/provision-and-use-azure-dsvm/media/3-remote-desktop-connection-warning.png)

# Exercise - Use Jupyter Notebooks

- 10 minutes

The Jupyter Notebook is a popular browser-based IDE for data science that is included in the DSVM. You can use Jupyter Notebooks to explore data and train models. The notebooks support both R and Python programming languages — specifically, Python 2, Python 3, Open Source R, and the Microsoft R Server. Although notebooks support rich annotations, they are programs that can execute entire data science pipelines.

## Why use Jupyter Notebooks?

### Create presentations with Jupyter Notebooks

The Jupyter Notebook integrates code, its output, and explanatory text all into a single document. Comparing to a traditional code editor, it's great for presentation because the file can contain items such as visualizations, tables, narrative texts, and equations.

### Collaborate with Jupyter Notebooks

You can export a Jupyter Notebook to different formats. By downloading it as an HTML file, you can share the results with a small group of people. Alternatively, you can save the notebook to its native format, with the **.ipynb** file extension, and then upload it to GitHub for a more direct sharing.

### Perform exploratory analysis with Jupyter Notebooks

The development process on Jupyter Notebook is extremely interactive. You write a small piece of code, observe the output immediately, and then write another piece of code. This is consistent with what data scientists do in their day-to-day work because data science is an iterative and exploratory process.

### Use multiple programming languages with Jupyter Notebooks

The Jupyter Notebook is a machine learning development environment for virtually any language. Jupyter Notebooks use a kernel-based architecture that separates the language interpreter from the notebook. Within the notebook you can use any language that has a Jupyter language kernel. All popular data science languages, including Python, R, Julia, and Java have kernels available.

## Create a simple Jupyter notebook.

1. To Use Jupyter Notebook, click the start menu tile, or the **Jupyter** icon on the desktop:

   ![Screenshot of the Start menu with the Jupyter Notebook tile selected.](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/data-ai-cert/provision-and-use-azure-dsvm/media/4-start-menu.png)

2. Under the **Files** tab, you can see the list of folders and files in the current directory. Select the location where you want to create your notebook.

3. In the right upper corner, click **New** to create a new notebook and select **Python 3** as the target language. Notice several language kernels are installed for you but you can install more if you like.

   ![Screenshot of the Jupyter, with the File tab selected. The New drop-down menu is selected as well.](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/data-ai-cert/provision-and-use-azure-dsvm/media/4-jupyter-code-cell.png)

4. A new notebook is created, and an empty code cell waits for your input. You can run, add, remove, or edit the cells. The toolbar buttons allow you to complete various operations on selected cells such as: Delete, Copy, Move, and Run.

5. Type the following code into the cell and hit Shift+Enter at the end of the line to run the cell.

   PythonCopy

   ```python
   print("Hello World")
   ```

    Tip

   Two commonly used keyboard shortcuts are Ctrl+Enter to run the selected cell, and Shift+Enter** to run the selected cell, move to the next cell when the selected cell is not the last one, and add a new cell.

   To open a full list of keyboard shortcuts, click on the keyboard icon in the toolbar. ![Screenshot of the Keyboard icon.](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/data-ai-cert/provision-and-use-azure-dsvm/media/4-keyboard-icon.png)

6. You should see it echo "Hello World" below the cell. By default, cells execute in the *kernel*, which is a computational engine that executes the code contained in the cell.

7. Jupyter notebooks support other cell types - use the **Insert > Insert Cell Below** menu option to add a new cell to the notebook.

8. Select the new cell by clicking in the input area (it will have a colored line next to it when selected).

9. In the menu header, find the cell type - it's a drop down list which likely has "Code" selected currently. Select "Heading" from the list.

   ![Screenshot showing the cell type dropdown list.](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/data-ai-cert/provision-and-use-azure-dsvm/media/4-add-heading.png)

    Note

   Don't worry about the raw cell type; this cell type is used to format output when exporting the notebook using the NBConvert tool.

10. Heading cell types are just Markdown headers which are prefixed with `#` to create an H1/H2/H3/H4 heading. Type `### This is a heading` into the cell.

11. Add another cell by typing Shift+Enter and change the cell type to "Markdown".

12. Set the value to "`This is Markdown`" without the quotes - notice the backtick character - this denotes a "code" block and it will be formatted with a monospace font. You can use any Markdown syntax here to document or annotate your Python code.

    ![Screenshot of Jupyter executing Markdown.](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/data-ai-cert/provision-and-use-azure-dsvm/media/4-execute-jupyter-markdown.png)

13. Notice that the Python cell you entered first has an **In** prefix. Output from the **In** executed code displays in the cell immediately below, and is labeled **Out**.

14. Add a new code cell to the bottom and type in the following Python code.

    PythonCopy

    ```python
    %pylab inline
    print("Python is easy to learn!")
    
    plot(randn(100))
    ```

15. Execute the cell. Notice that it shows an **Out** cell with the cell number in brackets as shown in the following image.

    ![Screenshot of the Jupyter execution results. Under the code is a plot line graph.](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/data-ai-cert/provision-and-use-azure-dsvm/media/4-jupyter-execution-result.png)

# Explore the pre-installed learning tools

- 8 minutes

The DSVM provides a wide selection of languages, development, machine learning, and data visualization tools, and data platforms that enable you to accomplish most data science tasks. Some examples of those tasks are as follows:

| Task                             | Provided tools                                               |
| :------------------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------- |
| Find, load, and preprocess data. | Use the preinstalled data platform and ingestion tools, such as Azure Blob Storage, Azure Data Lake, Azure HDInsight Hadoop, Azure Cosmos DB, Azure SQL Data Warehouse, and databases. |
| Train and test models.           | Use Jupyter Notebook, Microsoft Visual Studio, and Visual Studio Code as development tools. Select your preferred language (R or Python) to leverage the powerful tools included in the Microsoft Machine Learning Server (for example, Microsoft R Server as you saw in the earlier section). |
| Operationalize the model.        | Use R and Python Azure Machine Learning to deploy your model. Then client applications can access your models using a simple web service interface. |
| Train deep learning models.      | Use deep learning platforms such as PyTorch, scikit-learn, and TensorFlow, which supports GPU computation to accelerate the model training. |
| Visualize data.                  | Use the Microsoft Power BI desktop to build reports and dashboards, and use the one-click feature to publish to the cloud. |
| Share files and code.            | Create Azure file storage as a mountable drive on your DSVM to share large-scale datasets/code with your team. Use Git clients such as Git Bash and Git GUI to access your repository and share code with your team. |
| Perform cloud administration.    | Use the Azure portal or PowerShell to manage your Azure resources. Options include restarting or stopping your VM, dynamically scaling your DSVM to meet your project needs, or extending your storage space. |

## Learn with preloaded Jupyter Notebooks

The DSVM has preloaded notebooks for learning purposes. The preloaded notebooks are designed to teach you how to use various Azure services, such as the Azure Machine Learning service, SQL Server with Machine Learning Services, and Cognitive Services. To access the notebooks, launch the Jupyter Notebook and open the Notebooks folder. Subject areas are in separate subfolders.

![Screenshot of Jupyter Notebooks.](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/data-ai-cert/provision-and-use-azure-dsvm/media/5-jupyter-reference.png)

 Note

The SQL Server Developer Edition is installed with Machine Learning Server, and both data and code are loaded into the local database instance.

# Summary

- 5 minutes

In this module you learned how to provision, connect to, and use a DSVM. You also explored the Jupyter notebook and learned about its uses. You also learned that a DSVM is a powerful learning tool with software, sample code, and data to learn how to use many of the Azure data and AI services.

## Clean up

The sandbox automatically cleans up your resources when you're finished with this module.

When you're working in your own subscription, it's a good idea at the end of a project to identify whether you still need the resources you created. Resources left running can cost you money. You can delete resources individually or delete the resource group to delete the entire set of resources.
